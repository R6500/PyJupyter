    "## mmVar Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The **mmVar** class is the main element on the mmVars module.\n",
    "\n",
    "It defines an object associated to **minimum** and **maximum** values.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a new mmVar object using different constructors. Assuming that the module is imported as **mm**, the generic constructor is:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`var = mm.mmVar(a,b=None,typ=None,tol=None,s=None,ns=0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor is complex because it admits several modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you can use the following code to define a variable with values between **min** and **max**:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`var = mm.mmVar(min,max)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The module automatically detects wich is maximum and minimum, so the following code is equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`var = mm.mmVar(max,min)`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define a **typical** value for the variable that must be between the maximum and minimum values:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`var = mm.mmVar(max,min,typ)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable can also be defined by a **central value** and a **tolerance**:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`var = mm.mmVar(central,tol)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case it defines:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$max = central \\cdot (1+tol)$\n",
    "\n",
    ">$min = central \\cdot (1-tol)$\n",
    "\n",
    ">$typ = central$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only provide one parameter, it will define a constant:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`var = mm.mmVar(value)`\n",
    "\n",
    "So that:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$max = min = typ = value$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define two possible **probability distributions** to be used in later **montecarlo** methods. By default the distribution is [uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)), that means that all possible values between the maximum and minimum are equally probable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) distribtion if, in any of the above constructor methods, a parameter **ns** is used, like in:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`var = mm.mmVar(min,max,ns=3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ns** paramenter defines the number of [standard deviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) $\\sigma$ between the central and the maximum or minimum values. For instance, ns value of 3 means that any value of the variable has a 99,7% chance to be in the region between the defined maximum and the minimum values. Note that a normal distribution has **no bounds**, so random values can be outside of the region defined by the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't define a **typical** value for a variable defined with a **normal distribution**, the typical value will be set equal to the center value:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$typ_{normal}=\\frac{max+min}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In **uniform** distribution variables the typical value can be left **undefined**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of **normal** distributions you can also define the $\\sigma$ value using the **s** parameter of the constructor. That way, the following constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`var = mmVars.(10,s=1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Will define a **normal** variable with $\\sigma=1$. By default the limits are defined at $3\\sigma$ so the **maximum** of the variable will be 13 and the **minimum** will be 7. If you want, you can define the $\\sigma$ and the **ns** at the same time, so:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`var = mmVars.(10,s=1,ns=2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Will define a **normal** variable with $\\sigma=1$, **maximum** will be 12 and **minimum** will be 8 because we have defined they to be at a $2\\sigma$ distance from the certer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some **constructor** examples. The limits of each variable is shown as **(max:typ:min)**\n",
