# PyJupyter

Some Notebooks to learn Python coding

The PyJupyter system is just a bunch of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) to learn coding in [Python](https://www.python.org/) specifically for science and engineering.

So, the user interface is built around **Jupyter Notebooks** that contain **Python** Code

In order to use the software you need to have a working Python 3 system with Jupyter installed

Copy the main *"PyJupyter"* folder to anywhere in your system

Jupyter shall start on the *"PyJupyter/Jupyter"* folder

Before starting Jupyter, the **PHYTHONPATH** variable should point to the *"PyJupyter/Code"* folder

The *"PyJupyter/Jupyter.bat"* and the *"PyJupyter Custom.bat"* files are launch script examples for Windows that works for an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python3 installation.

The *"PyJupyter/Jupyter.sh"* is a launch script example for Linux that also works for an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python3 installation.

All the files are provided in a zip file *"PyJupyter (version).zip"* file to ease downloading.
